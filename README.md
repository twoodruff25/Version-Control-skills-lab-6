The program will then display the computers least favorite animal as well with a chance of a surprise? If you are lucky of course. *hint: easter egg*

Any machine that has this version of Python installed will be able to run it using the standard command prompt protocol. 
For any help installing python please reference the offical website [Link] (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Furthermore, if help is needed to run this program please reference how to run python scripts here 'https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/'

Note: *Any and all necessary imports are provided by the standard python packages accessible to all upon installation.* 

**Usage:** 

    Provide the program with your name, and least favorite animal. It could be your least favorite animal of the day or maybe all-time, it is entirely up to you. 
    The computer will then decide which animal is his least favorite animal of the day and reply it back to you. 
    On the off-chance you both provide the same animal, the computer will celebrate this hatred with you!
