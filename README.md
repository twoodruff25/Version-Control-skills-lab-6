The program will then display the computers least favorite animal as well with a chance of a surprise? If you are lucky of course. *hint: easter egg*

## Usage:

Provide the program with your name, and least favorite animal. It could be your least favorite animal of the day or maybe all-time, it is entirely up to you. 

The computer will then decide which animal is his least favorite animal of the day and reply it back to you. 
On the off-chance you both provide the same animal, the computer will celebrate this hatred with you!
